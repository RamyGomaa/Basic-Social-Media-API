# Basic-Social-Media-API

This is a simple Social Media API made with FastAPI

In this app we used PostgreSQL as a database, SQLAlchemy to facilitates the communication between Python programs and the database, Alembic as a database migration tool

This app has only three tables. USER, POST, VOTES

Where you can create a user, login and get a JWT token, and use this token to make crud operations on posts and vote on other users post
